This code will open the image, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise, and optionally save or display the rotated image.\n\nMake sure to have Pillow installed, and this code should work for your task."

Consider starting it at a time when most of your guests will be free from work or other commitments, such as 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM.\nLocation:\n\nThe party will be at your home. Ensure you have a designated space for the DJ setup and dancing. If possible, create a cozy sitting area for guests who might want to chat or take a break from dancing.\nGuest List:\n\nYou plan to invite 20 guests.\nSince it's a digital invitation, consider platforms like Evite, Paperless Post, or even a group email. Ensure you ask for RSVPs so you can get an accurate headcount.\nFood and Drink:\n\nYou mentioned serving cake. Depending on the size and preferences of your group, consider a large cake or perhaps individual cupcakes. This way, serving is easier, and you can cater to different flavor preferences.\nEven if it's just cake, ensure you have beverages - both non-alcoholic and possibly a few alcoholic choices. Soft drinks, water, and perhaps a signature cocktail or wine could be options.\nEntertainment:\n\nYou've chosen a DJ for entertainment. Make sure you communicate your music preferences to them beforehand. It would also be a good idea to ask guests if they have any song requests or favorite tunes they'd love to dance to.\nDecorations:\n\nYou mentioned you're not focusing on decorations, but even some simple string lights or a few balloons can create a festive atmosphere without too much effort or expense.\nBudget:\n\nAlthough you haven't specified a budget, it's always wise to make a rough estimate of the expected expenses. This includes the cost of the DJ, cake, beverages, and any minimal decor or other items you decide to incorporate.\nPreparation Steps:\n\nCreate and send out the digital invitations.\nContact a bakery to order the cake or cupcakes.\nDecide on the beverages you'll serve and ensure you have enough for all guests.\nConnect with the DJ. Discuss the setup space, time, music preferences, and any other requirements.\nConsider the layout of your home. If you have furniture that might obstruct the dance area or sitting spots, think about rearranging for the evening.\nDecide if you'd like to incorporate any simple decorations or lighting.\nOn the day of the party, ensure the DJ has ample time to set up before guests arrive.\nHave a space designated for guests to place their belongings, like a coat check area.\nRemember to enjoy the process and have fun! The primary goal is to celebrate and create memorable moments with your friends and family. If you need further advice or assistance on any point, feel free to ask. Happy planning!"

Make sure to ask about catering options as well.\n\n12. **Age Group:** With guests aged 20-25, you can plan activities and entertainment that cater to a young adult crowd. Consider their interests and preferences when making choices.\n\n13. **Digital Invitations:** Create stylish digital invitations that incorporate the Mafia theme. You can use online invitation platforms or hire a graphic designer to make them unique.\n\n14. **Mafia Theme Decorations:** Decorate the venue with classic Mafia elements like black and red color schemes, playing cards, fake money, and images of famous gangsters. You could also set up a photo booth with props for fun pictures.\n\n15. **Dress Code:** Encourage guests to come dressed in Mafia-inspired attire like suits, fedoras, and trench coats. It adds to the atmosphere and makes for great photos.\n\n16. **Live Band:** Since you prefer pop music, choose a live band that specializes in playing popular pop songs. You can provide them with a playlist of your favorite pop hits.\n\n17. **Transportation:** If needed, consider arranging transportation for guests who may have difficulty getting to the hotel.\n\n18. **Safety Measures:** Stay updated on local health guidelines and take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of your guests. This might include providing hand sanitizers, masks, or enforcing social distancing if required.\n\n19. **Additional Activities:** For a Mafia-themed party, you could organize a fun game of \"Mafia\" (the party game) or hire actors to perform a short interactive Mafia-themed skit.\n\n20. **Food Suggestions:** Since you've chosen halal and vegetarian options, consider a buffet-style dinner with a variety of dishes to accommodate different dietary preferences. Some ideas include halal chicken or vegetarian pasta dishes, salads, and a selection of desserts.\n\nRemember to coordinate with the hotel, finalize your guest list, and keep track of RSVPs.

You could offer finger foods such as sandwiches, wraps, and fruit platters, as well as drinks like soda, bottled water, and juice.\n* Activities: If you want to include activities, you could set up a few lawn games such as cornhole or ring toss. You could also have a movie night with a projector and a screen set up in the backyard (if you have one).\n* Music and Entertainment: If you want some music, you could create a playlist of your brother's favorite songs or hire a DJ to play during the party. If you want entertainment, you could hire a clown or a magician to perform for the kids.\n* Number of Guests: Since you're expecting 10-15 guests, you'll want to make sure you have enough food and drinks for everyone. You may also want to consider the size of your home and make sure there's enough space for everyone to move around comfortably.\n* Special Requirements: If you have any specific requests or requirements for the party, let me know and I can help you plan accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps get you started in planning your brother's birthday party! Let me know if you have any other questions."

It's a simple and delicious dish that can be made with a variety of vegetables, and it's high in protein and fiber. Here's a basic recipe you can follow:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup quinoa * 2 cups water * 2 tablespoons olive oil * 1 red bell pepper, sliced * 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced * 1 small onion, sliced * 2 cloves garlic, minced * 1 cup mixed vegetables (such as broccoli, carrots, and peas) * Salt and pepper to taste * Optional: 1 teaspoon soy sauce or tamari\n\nInstructions:\n\nRinse the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and place it in a medium saucepan with the water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, about 15-20 minutes.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers, onion, and garlic and stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp, about 5-7 minutes.\nAdd the mixed vegetables and cook for another 3-5 minutes, or until they are tender but still crisp. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nFluff the cooked quinoa with a fork and serve with the stir-fried vegetables. If desired, you can add a drizzle of soy sauce or tamari to the dish for extra flavor.\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!

Instead, it's a guide to flavor combinations, allowing your friend to get creative and experiment with their dishes.\n\n\"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat\" by Samin Nosrat: This book explains the fundamental elements that make food delicious and teaches readers how to balance these elements when cooking. It's both educational and practical with recipes.\n\nThemed Cookbooks: Depending on what they might be interested in, there are many themed cookbooks, like vegetarian cooking, world cuisines, or even molecular gastronomy.\n\nLocal Cookbooks: Sometimes, local bookstores or markets will have cookbooks specific to your area's cuisine. This could be a beautiful and thoughtful gift.\n\nWhen selecting a cookbook, you might also want to consider its aesthetic appeal, as your friend is creative and might appreciate a beautifully designed book.\n\nLastly, consider writing a personal note or message inside the cookbook to add a personal touch to your gift.\n\nI hope this helps! Your friend is lucky to have someone so thoughtful in their life."

It's important to also include proper rest days in order to allow your muscles to recover and grow. Now, let's talk about the exercises you'll be doing. For building muscle, compound exercises are typically the most effective. These are exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. Here are some examples of compound exercises you can include in your workout routine:\n\n* Bench press\n* Pull-ups\n* Barbell rows\n* Dumbbell rows\n* Push-ups\n* Dumbbell shoulder press\n* T-bar row\n* Dumbbell fly\n* Cable rows\n* Dumbbell curls\n* Hammer curls\n* Tricep dips\n* Skull crushers\n\nIt's recommended to do 3-4 sets of each exercise with a weight that allows you to perform 8-12 reps per set. Don't forget to warm up before your workout with some light cardio and stretching to prevent injury. I hope this helps get you started on your fitness journey!

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with. Here is a simple and easy to understand version of your personalized fitness routine: Swimming is a great cardio exercise, so continue to include it in your routine 2 times a week. In addition to swimming, include bodyweight exercises that target all major muscle groups. You can do these exercises at home, and there are many available resources online or in books that provide detailed instructions and videos. Start with 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions for each exercise, with a rest period of 60 seconds between sets. As you get stronger, increase the difficulty of the exercises by using different variations or adding weight. Focus on building muscle and strength, so make sure to progressively increase the difficulty of your exercises over time. Remember to listen to your body and rest when needed. If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop the exercise and consult a doctor or physical therapist. Maintain a healthy diet to support your fitness goals, such as a keto diet. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Consistency is key, so aim to follow this routine 5 days a week. If you need to adjust the routine based on your schedule, that's okay. Just make sure to stay consistent and keep pushing yourself to improve. I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with!"

You can check reviews online to find a suitable spot. Picnic Supplies: A comfortable picnic blanket or beach mat. Portable, insulated cooler or bag. Drinks of choice (perhaps some sparkling water, soda, or even a bottle of wine if both of you drink). Portable speaker (for some light music in the background). Pizza: This will be the highlight. Since it's hard to make pizza at a beach: Order a fresh pizza from one of the best places in town (preferably your partner's favorite). Make sure to keep it warm; there are portable pizza warmers/bags that you can buy or even use aluminum foil and a thermal bag. Alternatively, if you're feeling adventurous, you could try making your pizza together at home and then pack it for the beach. Swimming: Bring along swimsuits, towels, and a change of clothes. A waterproof bag or pouch for valuables. The Date: The Surprise: Tell your significant other you've planned an outdoor evening for both of you but keep the exact activities as a surprise. Arrival: Reach the beach or lakeside a little before sunset. Set up your picnic spot. Pizza Time: Once you've settled, unveil the pizza and enjoy it with the drinks and perhaps some light music in the background. Swim: After you've eaten and as the sun sets, suggest a relaxing swim. The sunset ambiance will make it magical. Stargazing: Once it's dark, if the location is apt and the skies are clear, lay back on your blanket, and enjoy some stargazing. Wrapping Up: As the evening winds down, pack up your things and head back home, cherishing the memories you've just created. Remember, the most important thing is the effort and thought you put into making the date special. The details and activities are just tools to help create a memorable experience. Enjoy your date!"

After the class, enjoy a meal together and share the dishes you've learned to make. A live music show: Take your partner to a live music show featuring Kazakh or Central Asian music, such as a performance by a traditional ensemble or a modern band. A food and music festival: Check to see if there's a local food and music festival in your area that features Kazakh or Central Asian cuisine and music. This would be a great opportunity to experience a variety of tastes and sounds. A music tour: If your partner is a fan of a particular band or artist, see if you can arrange for a private tour of the venue where they'll be performing, followed by a concert ticket. As for the actual date, you could start by picking your partner up at their home or place of work, and then lead them to the surprise destination. You could also add some extra touches, such as creating a playlist of Kazakh music or incorporating elements of Kazakh culture into the surprise (e.g. using a traditional Kazakh blanket as a tablecloth at the restaurant, etc.)."

Here's my suggestion based on the information: Your budget of $50, especially if that needs to include accommodations, is quite limited for most destinations, especially when considering the cost of travel to and from the destination, meals, activities, and other expenses. Given this, I'd suggest looking into a local \"staycation\" where you can explore the cultural offerings in your own city or a nearby town. This allows you to save on transportation costs and get the most value from your budget. Possible Activities and Ideas: Local Museums or Historical Sites: Many cities have local museums, art galleries, or historical sites that either have free admission or charge a minimal fee. Walking Tours: You can look for self-guided walking tours of your city, which often highlight historical and cultural landmarks. Local Cultural Festivals or Events: Check local event calendars to see if there are any cultural events, markets, or festivals happening during the weekend you're considering.

Here is a general skincare routine that you can try, but please keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, and you may need to make adjustments based on how your skin reacts to each product. Step 1: Cleanse * Use a gentle, non-foaming cleanser to remove dirt and oil from your skin. Look for a cleanser that is formulated for your skin type (in this case, a cleanser for combination skin). * Cleanse your skin twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Step 2: Toner * Use a toner that is formulated for your skin type to help balance your skin's pH and remove any remaining impurities. * Use a toner only in the evening to avoid over-drying your skin. Step 3: Spot Treatment * If you have acne-prone skin, consider using a spot treatment on any pimples that pop up. Look for a spot treatment that contains ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or tea tree oil. Step 4: Serum * Use a serum that is formulated for your skin type to help hydrate and nourish your skin. * Apply a few drops of serum to your skin after cleansing and toning, but before applying your moisturizer. Step 5: Moisturizer * Use a moisturizer that is formulated for your skin type to help hydrate and lock in moisture. * Apply a small amount of moisturizer to your skin after applying your serum, concentrating on the areas that feel dry or tight. In addition to your skincare routine, there are some general tips that you can follow to help manage your combination skin: * Avoid touching your face and try not to sleep on your pillow with your face * Use a makeup remover to remove all traces of makeup before cleansing your skin * Avoid using too many skincare"

Moisturize: Since you have white skin, opt for a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer like Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, which provides hydration without clogging pores. Apply it in the morning after cleansing. Sun protection: Always wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. A affordable option is Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110, which is lightweight and non-greasy. Reapply every two hours or after sweating, swimming, or towel-drying. Remember to be patient and consistent with your skincare routine. If you notice any adverse reactions or skin irritation, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist for further advice.

Based on the information you've given, here's a customized study plan for your IELTS preparation: Customized IELTS Study Plan Goal: Improve IELTS Score Duration: Assuming you want to start immediately, we'll set this plan for a 3-month period. Resources: IELTS preparation course (you mentioned you prefer courses). Weekly Schedule (15 hours/week): 1. Monday to Friday (2 hours/day): First 30 minutes: Vocabulary building. Focus on a set of words each day. Write sentences, synonyms, antonyms, and practice their pronunciation. Next 1 hour: Dedicate this hour to practicing one of the four IELTS sections (Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking) on rotation. Last 30 minutes: Review errors from the practice session. For speaking, this can be self-assessment or using a tool/app that provides feedback. 2. Saturday (5 hours): First 2 hours: Practice full Listening and Reading tests. Since they're time-bound, simulate exam conditions. Next 1 hour: Break. Last 2 hours: Write both tasks of the IELTS Writing section. Ideally, find a mentor or online platform where you can submit your essays for feedback. 3. Sunday (1 hour): Rest and relaxation. If you feel like it, spend an hour watching English movies, shows, or listening to podcasts to immerse yourself in the language. General Tips: Feedback is Key: Whenever possible, get feedback on your writing and speaking. Websites, forums, or IELTS-focused communities can be beneficial. Time Management: One of the challenges of the IELTS is time management. Always practice sections with a timer. Mock Tests: Every two weeks, attempt a full IELTS mock test to gauge your progress. Adjust your study plan based on areas of weakness. Environment: Since you prefer studying at home, ensure you have a quiet, distraction-free environment. Consider noise-cancelling headphones or apps that play white noise if needed. Stay Updated: Occasionally, check the official IELTS website or related forums for any updates or changes in the exam pattern. Stay Motivated: Remember the reason you're taking the IELTS. Whether it's for study, work, or migration, keeping the end goal in mind can be a significant motivation. This plan is a template to get you started. Adjustments might be needed based on your progress and feedback. Remember, consistency is crucial, and practice will help improve your skills over time. Best of luck with your IELTS preparation!"

Based on your responses, it sounds like you have some experience with programming and web development, but you don't have any prior knowledge of blockchain technology or smart contract programming. Given your schedule and learning goals, I would recommend starting with an introduction to blockchain technology and smart contract programming. Here's a suggested study plan for you: Start by learning the basics of blockchain technology and its underlying principles. You can use online resources such as the Solidity documentation, the Ethereum Wiki, or other online tutorials to get started. Once you have a basic understanding of blockchain technology, move on to learning Solidity, the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. You can use online resources such as the Solidity documentation or online tutorials to learn the language. As you're learning Solidity, start working on simple contracts and experimenting with different features of the language. Try to create small, simple contracts that do something useful, such as a contract that stores a user's name and address, and allows them to withdraw a certain amount of tokens. Once you have a good understanding of Solidity and have created a few small contracts, move on to more advanced topics such as web3.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. This library allows you to interact with smart contracts from web browsers and other JavaScript-based environments. Continue learning more advanced topics in Solidity and smart contract programming as you progress. You can use resources such as the Solidity documentation, online tutorials, and open-source projects on GitHub to learn more. As you gain more experience, consider working on projects that integrate smart contracts with other technologies such as web development, machine learning, or data analytics. Remember to practice regularly and consistently, and to seek out resources and communities that can provide additional support and guidance. Good luck with your learning journey!"

She's a shy, quiet girl, always blending into the background. She never raises her hand or participates much in class discussions.**Supporting Characters**: 1. Mrs. Kline - The stern, aged literature teacher who seems to have a soft spot for Lila, though no one can figure out why. 2. Jake - A popular student in Lila's class. He's confident, outspoken, and everything Lila isn't.**Conflict**: Lila discovers an old journal tucked away in the library. As she reads through the pages, she realizes it once belonged to Mrs. Kline when she was a student at the same school. The journal reveals Mrs. Kline's own struggles with shyness and her determination to overcome it. Inspired by the journal, Lila decides she wants to share it with the class, thinking it might change their perception of Mrs. Kline and help others who face the same struggles.**Mood/Tone**: The tone of the story is melancholic. As we follow Lila's journey with the journal, we get glimpses into Mrs. Kline's past \u2013 her dreams, her fears, and her transformation.**Unique Elements**: The journal contains poems written by a young Mrs. Kline, revealing her depth and her passion for literature. It serves as a bridge between Lila and her teacher.**Ending**: After sharing the journal with her class, Lila receives a mixed response. Some students ridicule her, while others are moved by the discovery. Jake, unexpectedly, comes forward and admits his own struggles with anxiety, changing the class dynamics. Mrs. Kline, moved by Lila's actions, privately shares another poem with her, one she wrote after her transformation. The poem is about hope in the face of adversity, and she gifts it to Lila, acknowledging the silent lessons they've shared.

Little does he know that this book is no ordinary spellbook; it's filled with mischievous, unpredictable spells.\n\nOne evening, while experimenting with one of the spells, Mike accidentally turns his cat into a miniature dragon. Chaos ensues as the tiny dragon creates havoc in his apartment. Mike has to find a way to reverse the spell and restore his cat to its original form.\n\nIn his quest to undo the magic, Mike embarks on a humorous adventure, seeking the help of a quirky local magician and a talking squirrel who seems to have some magical wisdom.

Based on what you've shared, I would suggest the following personalized morning routine: Set your alarm for the night before and try to go to bed at a reasonable time so you can get a good night's sleep. When your alarm goes off in the morning, wake up slowly by setting your alarm for an extra 10-15 minutes. This will give you time to gradually wake up and start your day off on the right foot. Take a warm shower to help wake up your body and start your day off on the right foot. Pray or meditate to clear your mind and set a positive tone for the day. Next, do some light stretching or yoga to help you feel more energized. If you want to exercise, consider doing it in the morning so you can get it out of the way and have more energy throughout the day. If you prefer, you could also do some lighter exercise, such as stretching or a short walk, after your morning prayer or meditation. Once you've completed your exercise, have a healthy breakfast that can give you sustained energy throughout the day. Spend a few minutes journaling or reflecting on your goals and priorities for the day. This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day.Try to avoid checking your phone or social media first thing in the morning. Instead, take a few minutes to read something inspiring or educational to start your day off on a positive note. Finally, try to get into a routine of going to bed and waking up at the same time every day to help regulate your body's natural rhythms and improve your overall sleep quality. I hope this routine helps you start your day off on the right foot and achieve your goals. Remember to be flexible and adjust the routine as needed to fit your changing needs and preferences."
