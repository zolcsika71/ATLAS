If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) represent the tens and units digits of this product, respectively, what is the value of \\( a + b \\)?\"\n **Solution**: To find the tens and unit digits of the product, we only need to consider the tens and unit digits of 834,209 (which are 0 and 9) and 48,732 (which are 3 and 2). The product of 9 and 2 gives 18, which means the unit digit of the entire product is 8. To find the tens digit, we multiply the tens digit of one number with the unit digit of the other and add the product of the unit digits of both numbers, accounting for any carry-over. So, (9 * 3) + (0 * 2) + 1 (carry-over from 9 * 2) = 28. The tens digit is 8. Thus, \\( a + b = 8 + 8 = 16 \\).\n \n Example 2**: \"If \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are the tens and units digits, respectively, of the product 561,987 * 32,145, what is the value of \\( p + q \\)?\"\n \n **Solution**: Focus on the tens and units digits of 561,987 (which are 8 and 7) and 32,145 (which are 4 and 5). The product of 7 and 5 gives 35, meaning the unit digit of the entire product is 5. For the tens digit, we calculate (7 * 4) + (8 * 5) + 3 (carry-over from 7 * 5) = 63. The tens digit is 3. Therefore, \\( p + q = 3 + 5 = 8 \\).\n \n \n Question: If x and y are the tens digit and the units digit, respectively, of the product 725,278 * 67,066, what is the value of x + y?

We only need to consider the tens and units digits of each number to find the tens and units digits of the product.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Digits**:\n   - For 725,278, the tens digit is 7 and the units digit is 8.\n   - For 67,066, the tens digit is 6 and the units digit is 6.\n\n2. **Find the Units Digit (y)**:\n   - Multiply the units digits of both numbers: 8 * 6 = 48.\n   - The units digit of the product (y) is the units digit of 48, which is 8.\n\n3. **Find the Tens Digit (x)**:\n   - Multiply the tens digit of the first number with the units digit of the second: 7 * 6 = 42.\n   - Multiply the units digit of the first number with the tens digit of the second: 8 * 6 = 48.\n   - Add these two products: 42 + 48 = 90.\n   - Add any carry-over from the calculation of the units digit: 90 + 4 (from the 48 of the units digit calculation) = 94.\n   - The tens digit of the product (x) is the units digit of 94, which is 4.\n\n4. **Calculate x + y**:\n   - Therefore, \\( x + y = 4 + 8 = 12 \\).\n\nSo, the value of \\( x + y \\) is 12.

In this case, the units digits are 8 and 6. The product of 8 and 6 is 48, so the units digit (\\(y\\)) is 8.\n\n2. **Tens Digit (\\(x\\)):** For the tens digit, you need to consider the cross products of the tens and units digits of the two numbers being multiplied, along with any carry-overs. In this case:\n   - \\( (7 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 6) + 4 (\\text{carry-over from the units digit}) = 42 + 12 + 4 = 58 \\).\n   So, the tens digit (\\(x\\)) is 8.\n\nTherefore, the sum \\(x + y\\) is \\(8 + 8 = 16\\).",
