        "gpt4_output": "To solve this problem, we focus on the tens and units digits of the product \\(725,278 \\times 67,066\\). The crucial point here is that the tens and units digits of a product are only influenced by the tens and units digits of the factors. This means we don't need to consider the entire numbers, but just the last two digits of each.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The units digit of a product depends only on the units digits of the factors. In this case, the units digits are 8 (from 725,278) and 6 (from 67,066). To find the units digit of the product, we multiply these two units digits: \\(8 \\times 6\\).\n\n2. The tens digit of the product is influenced by the units digits of both numbers and the tens digit of one number (if there's a carry-over from the units multiplication). In this case, the tens digits are 7 (from 725,278) and 6 (from 67,066). We'll first multiply these and then add the carry-over from the units digit multiplication (if any).\n\nLet's calculate these:\n\n- Units digit calculation: \\(8 \\times 6\\) (we only need the units digit of this product).\n- Tens digit calculation: \\(7 \\times 6\\) plus the carry-over from the units digit multiplication.\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\nThe calculation yields the following:\n\n- The units digit of the product is 8.\n- The tens digit, after accounting for the carry-over from the units digit multiplication, is 6.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the tens digit (x) and the units digit (y) of the product \\(725,278 \\times 67,066\\) is \\(x + y = 6 + 8 = 14\\).",

The answer is \"yes\" because Mable was alive at noon.\nHere's a detailed explanation:\nThe puzzle states that Mable's heart rate at 9 AM was 75 bpm, and her blood pressure at 7 PM was 120/80. These are two separate pieces of information that don't seem to be related to each other. However, if we think creatively, we can find a connection between the two.\nThe key to this puzzle is to recognize that \"heart rate\" and \"blood pressure\" are both related to the circulatory system. The heart rate measures the number of times the heart beats per minute, while blood pressure measures the force of blood pushing against the artery walls.\nNow, let's consider what happens to the body during the day. When we wake up in the morning, our body starts to prepare for the day ahead. Our heart rate increases, and our blood pressure rises to ensure that our brain and other organs receive enough oxygen and nutrients. As the day progresses, our body continues to function, and our heart rate and blood pressure remain relatively constant.\nHowever, as the day comes to an end, our body starts to wind down. Our heart rate slows down, and our blood pressure decreases. This is why Mable's heart rate at 9 AM was 75 bpm, and her blood pressure at 7 PM was 120/80.\nNow, let's consider the question: Was Mable alive at noon? Based on the information provided, we can infer that Mable was indeed alive at noon. Here's why:\nIf Mable's heart rate at 9 AM was 75 bpm, it means that her body was functioning normally at that time. As the day progressed, her heart rate and blood pressure would have remained relatively constant. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that her heart rate and blood pressure at noon were also within a normal range.\nFurthermore, the puzzle states that Mable died at 11 PM. This means that she was alive at 10 PM, 9 PM, 8 PM, 7 PM (when her blood pressure was measured), 6 PM, 5 PM, 4 PM, 3 PM, 2 PM, and 1 PM. In other words, Mable was alive at every hour leading up to her death at 11 PM. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that she was also alive at noon.\nIn summary, Mable was alive at noon because her body was functioning normally at 9 AM, and there's no evidence to suggest that her condition changed significantly throughout the day. Her heart rate and blood pressure at 7 PM were within a normal range, indicating that she was still alive at that time. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that she was also alive at noon.",

Next, we need to calculate the value that the people in line place on the coffee. Since they value the coffee at 75 cents per cup, the total value of the coffee to them is $75 (100 cups x 75 cents per cup).\n3. The social cost of providing the coffee is the difference between the total cost to the government and the total value to the people in line.

To calculate the social cost of providing free coffee to people standing in line, we need to use a concept called \"opportunity cost.\" Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made. In this case, the opportunity cost is the value of the things that could have been produced or consumed instead of giving out free coffee.\n \n To calculate the opportunity cost, we need to consider what else the government could have done with the $1 per cup that they spent on coffee. Let's assume that the government could have used that money to produce something else that has a value of at least $0.75 per unit (which is the value that the people in line place on the coffee).\n \n For example, the government could have invested that money in building schools, hospitals, or infrastructure. These investments would provide long-term benefits to society as a whole, and their value would likely be greater than the $0.75 per unit that the people in line are willing to pay for the coffee. Therefore, the social cost of providing free coffee is the difference between the actual cost ($1 per cup) and the opportunity cost ($0.75 per unit).\n \n So, the social cost of providing free coffee in this scenario is:\n \n $1 - $0.75 = $0.25 per cup\n \n Therefore, the social cost of providing free coffee to people standing in line is $0.25 per cup."

        "gpt3.5_output": "Let's analyze the information provided:\n\nSally is one of the sisters, and she has 4 brothers. Each of these brothers also has 3 sisters (including Sally). So, the total number of sisters for each brother is 3 (including Sally).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sisters:\n\n1. Sally is one sister.\n2. Each of her 4 brothers has 3 sisters (including Sally).\n\nSo, for each brother, there are 3 sisters (including Sally). Since Sally is common to all brothers, we count her only once. Therefore, the total number of sisters is:\n\n\\[ 1 + (4 \\text{ brothers} \\times 3 \\text{ sisters per brother}) = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\nSally has a total of 13 sisters, including herself.",
        "llama2-70b_output": "\n#Answer\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sisters that Sally has, which is the sum of the number of sisters each of her brothers have.\nLet's first find the number of sisters each brother has:\nEach brother has 3 sisters, so the number of sisters each brother has is 3.\nNow, let's find the total number of sisters Sally has:\nThe total number of sisters Sally has is the sum of the number of sisters each brother has:\nTotal number of sisters = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12\nTherefore, Sally has 12 sisters.\nIn details, the solution is as follows:\n1. Each brother has 3 sisters, so the number of sisters each brother has is 3.\n2. The total number of sisters Sally has is the sum of the number of sisters each brother has:\n3. The total number of sisters = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12\n4. Therefore, Sally has 12 sisters.\nSo, the answer is 12.",

Each brother has 3 sisters.\nSo, the total number of sisters that Sally's brothers have is 4 x 3 = 12.\nNow, we need to find out how many of these sisters are also Sally's sisters.\n3. Sally is a girl, so she is a sister to all the girls who are her brothers' sisters.\nTherefore, the number of sisters that Sally has is 12 - 1 (Sally herself).\nSo, Sally has 11 sisters.\nThe answer is 11.",
