We are only interested in the contribution of the units digit of the first factor (725,278) to the product. The product of 8 (units digit of the first factor) and 6 (units digit of the second factor) is 48.\n\nNow, we want to find the tens digit of the result. The tens digit of the product is determined by adding the tens digit of the first factor (7) to the result of multiplying the tens digit of the first factor by the units digit of the second factor (7 * 6 = 42). Adding 7 and 42 gives us 49.\n\nNow, we only need the sum of the tens and units digits of this result (49).

The social cost is the value that the people in line place on the coffee, which is 75 cents per cup. This is because the people in line are the ones who benefit from the free coffee, and their valuation of it reflects the opportunity cost of the resources used to produce it.\nIn other words, if the government were to charge $1 per cup for the coffee, the people in line would not be willing to pay that price, as they only value the coffee at 75 cents per cup.

This is because the government is using resources to produce coffee that could be used to produce something else that would be valued at 75 cents per cup.\nExplanation:\nThe social cost of providing the coffee is not the same as the private cost of producing the coffee, which is $1 per cup. The private cost is the cost of production to the coffee producer, but the social cost is the opportunity cost of the resources used to produce the coffee. In this case, the social cost is lower than the private cost because the people in line value the coffee at a lower price than the cost of production.\nTherefore, the government should take into account the social cost of providing the coffee, which is 75 cents per cup, when making decisions about whether to continue providing free coffee to the people standing in line.",

        "llama1-13b_output": "No, Canada is not south of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is located in the northern hemisphere, and Canada is located in the northern hemisphere as well, but it is not directly south of the Arctic Ocean. \n \n The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by several countries, including Russia, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, and Canada. Canada is the largest country in the world to be covered by the Arctic Ocean, and it is located to the north of the Arctic Circle.",

        "gpt4_output": "The Porter Stemming Algorithm, designed for the English language, reduces words to their base or root form. For the word \"computational,\" the Porter stemmer would most likely stem it to \"comput.\" This is because the Porter stemmer removes common morphological and inflexional endings from words in English, such as \"-ational\" in this case, leaving the root form \"comput.\" \n ",

        "llama2-70b_output": "The correct answer is : \"computation\". \n When using the Porter stemmer, the word \"computational\" is stemmed to \"computation\" by removing the suffix \"-al\" and the suffix \"-ity\" from the original word.

        "llama2-13b_output": "The Porter stemmer does not have a fixed set of rules, so it is not possible to predict exactly how a given word will be stemmed. However, based on the rules of the Porter stemmer, it is likely that the word \"computational\" will be stemmed to \"compute\". The Porter stemmer removes suffixes from words to arrive at the stem, and \"computational\" ends in \"al\", which is a suffix that can be removed to form the stem \"compute\".",
        "llama2-7b_output": "When using the Porter stemmer, the word \"computational\" gets stemmed to \"comput\". \n \n The Porter stemmer is a popular stemming algorithm that was developed by J.K. Porter in 1980. It is a rule-based stemmer that uses a set of rules to reduce words to their base or root form. The stemmer is designed to handle irregular English words and to produce stems that are not inflected forms of other words. \n \n When applying the Porter stemmer to the word \"computational\", the stemmer will look for the most basic form of the word that can be derived from the given word. The stemmer will recognize that \"computational\" is a combination of the words \"computer\" and \"ational\", which means it can be stemmed to \"comput\" while preserving the meaning of the original word. \n",
